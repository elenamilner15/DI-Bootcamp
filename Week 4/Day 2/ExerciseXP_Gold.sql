-- Find a customer in the customer table, and change his/her details to your details, using SQL UPDATE.
-- Now find the customerâ€™s address, and use UPDATE to change the address to your address (or make one up).
--	!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

-- 	select rating, count(*) as num_films from film group by rating;
-- 	select * from film where rating in ('G', 'PG-13');
-- 	select * from film where rating in ('G', 'PG-13') and length <120 and rental_rate<3 order by title;
	
-- 	update customer
-- 	set first_name = 'Elena', last_name = 'Milner', email = 'elenamilner@sakilacustomer.org' where customer_id = 4;

-- 	update address
-- 	set address = '123 Rav Levi', district = 'Tel Aviv', city_id = (select city_id from city where city = 'Bat Yam')
